# ML-Library-II

1.Implemented  a light CNN architecture and tabulated its performance on a range of self-implemented activation functions .

2.Implemented a 'grid-search' feature for selecting the implemented activation functions which work best for a given dataset for a simple neural network.
activation Functions- Linear,sigmoid,Relu,leaky-Relu,tanh,softplus,mish,swish
